The syntax, supported formats, and features are the
same for Kafka and Redpanda broker. For simplicity, this page uses
"Kafka" to refer to both Kafka and Redpanda.

### Monitoring source progress

By default, Kafka sources expose progress metadata as a subsource that you can
use to monitor source **ingestion progress**. The name of the progress
subsource can be specified when creating a source using the `EXPOSE PROGRESS
AS` clause; otherwise, it will be named `<src_name>_progress`.

The following metadata is available for each source as a progress subsource:

Field          | Type                                     | Meaning
---------------|------------------------------------------|--------
`partition`    | `numrange`                               | The upstream Kafka partition.
`offset`       | [`uint8`](/sql/types/uint/#uint8-info)   | The greatest offset consumed from each upstream Kafka partition.

And can be queried using:

```mzsql
SELECT
  partition, "offset"
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      -- Take the upper of the range, which is null for non-partition rows
      -- Cast partition to u64, which is more ergonomic
      upper(partition)::uint8 AS partition, "offset"
    FROM
      <src_name>_progress
  )
WHERE
  -- Remove all non-partition rows
  partition IS NOT NULL;
```

As long as any offset continues increasing, Materialize is consuming data from
the upstream Kafka broker. For more details on monitoring source ingestion
progress and debugging related issues, see [Troubleshooting](/ops/troubleshooting/).

### Monitoring consumer lag

To support Kafka tools that monitor consumer lag, Kafka sources commit offsets
once the messages up through that offset have been durably recorded in
Materialize's storage layer.

However, rather than relying on committed offsets, Materialize suggests using
our native [progress monitoring](#monitoring-source-progress), which contains
more up-to-date information.

{{< note >}}
Some Kafka monitoring tools may indicate that Materialize's consumer groups have
no active members. This is **not a cause for concern**.

Materialize does not participate in the consumer group protocol nor does it
recover on restart by reading the committed offsets. The committed offsets are
provided solely for the benefit of Kafka monitoring tools.
{{< /note >}}

Committed offsets are associated with a consumer group specific to the source.
The ID of the consumer group consists of the prefix configured with the [`GROUP
ID PREFIX` option](#connection-options) followed by a Materialize-generated
suffix.

You should not make assumptions about the number of consumer groups that
Materialize will use to consume from a given source. The only guarantee is that
the ID of each consumer group will begin with the configured prefix.

The consumer group ID prefix for each Kafka source in the system is available in
the `group_id_prefix` column of the [`mz_kafka_sources`] table. To look up the
`group_id_prefix` for a source by name, use:

```mzsql
SELECT group_id_prefix
FROM mz_internal.mz_kafka_sources ks
JOIN mz_sources s ON s.id = ks.id
WHERE s.name = '<src_name>'
```

### Required Kafka ACLs

The access control lists (ACLs) on the Kafka cluster must allow Materialize
to perform the following operations on the following resources:

Operation type | Resource type    | Resource name
---------------|------------------|--------------
Read           | Topic            | The specified `TOPIC` option
Read           | Group            | All group IDs starting with the specified [`GROUP ID PREFIX` option](#connection-options)

You specify the formats when creating a table from a Kafka source.  See [CREATE
TABLE: Kafka](/create-table/kafka/) for details.
